# Furtherance
Furtherance is a time tracking app.
It allows you to track time spent on different activities without worrying about your data being captured and sold.

## Features
* Tasks are saved in a database with an unlimited capacity. It can be backed up for security and portability.
* Tasks are grouped by name and date.
* Tasks can be edited after they are created (name, time, and date).
* Settings to customize the defaults to your liking.
* Features can be added! Just open an issue.
